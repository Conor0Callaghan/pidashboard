# Git repository for personal dashboard

This repository contains the code used to run a small dashboard on a raspberry pi screen. This was featured in the [opensource.com article](https://opensource.com/article/17/3/pi-display-dashboard)

## Notes

  * The keys used for the TFL transport API and any other API keys have been removed.
  * The code is for reference purposes only and probably will not work (I don't have a lot of time at the moment to spin this up and test it)
  * The code hasn't been packaged in a friendly format (with requiremnts etc.)
  * There is a loop/timing issue somewhere in the code that causes excessive polling of certain APIs e.g. weather API
